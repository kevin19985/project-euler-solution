# project-euler-solution
Code for Project Euler problems written in language I like

For now, Mathematica is the solution language.
Maybe Haskell or other language would be added.

Notice. This project is just to familiarize myself with those programming language syntax,
so I'll use as many of the facilities offered by each language as possible,
including built-in functions and unique data structures.

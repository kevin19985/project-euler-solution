File name is the problem's id in Project Euler

All code run on Mathematica 12.
I strongly recommend you to run those files in Mathematica,
or copy the code and paste/run it in wolframscript command line. 
Of course, you can also run it directly in command line with `wolframscript -f p1.wl`,
but remember to add function `Print` to show the output, otherwise you'll get nothing in the terminal.
If you want to execute it directly like `./p1.wl`, check whether `#!/usr/bin/env wolframscript` is in the head line, and make it excutable.
